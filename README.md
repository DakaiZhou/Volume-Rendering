# Volume-Rendering
It is a demo of user interactive volume rendering by applying ray casting algoritm in Python. It has not integrated with image rotation function yet. But it has unser interactive Transfer Function. 

Since the goal of this work is to understand the algorithm, the code does not use any image processing packages such as OpenGL, OpenCV, etc.

To use the code, change the file path in InteractiveDirectVolRendering.py
