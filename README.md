# Volume-Rendering
It is a demo of user interactive volume rendering by applying ray casting algoritm in Python. It has not integrated with image rotation function yet. But it has unser interactive Transfer Function. 

Since the goal of this work is to understand the algorithm, the code does not contain any image processing packages such as OpenGL, OpenCV, etc.

To run the code, change the file path in InteractiveDirectVolRendering.py


# Example Result
The quality of the result heavily depends on the setting of the Transfer Function, namely the setting of the interactive plot shown as below.
